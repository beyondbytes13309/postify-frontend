# Postify Frontend

This readme will define all the features of this frontend application. The backend will be integrated later.

## Pages

This react application will use react-dom-router for making a single-page-site. It will have multiple pages.

1. Signin/Signup page: This page will do what the name says
2. Home Page: This page will show the feed of all the posts and stuff which it will fetch from the API.
3. Profile Page: This page will show the user's profile in which they can change their profile and stuff; and if the user is not logged in it will be a signin/signup button instead
4. New Post Page: This page will allow the user to create a post. This user can use text and images in their post
